Diarchy is a Spartan server written in Elixir. The implementation emphasizes robustness, correctness, and speed.

Development mainly happens on Sourcehut: https://sr.ht/~slondr/diarchy/

The name comes from the form of government of ancient Sparta, which featured two kings from different dynasties in co-rule, each with veto ability over the other.

By default Diarchy listens on port 3000 so users can play around with it without needing root access. Set the PORT environment variable to over-ride this.

Diarchy is capable of serving requests now, but see [[file:ROADMAP.org][the roadmap]] for what's left until v1.0.
